# Ray Tracer
This program renders an image of user-specified 3D spheres.
First it takes input for the location, size, and color of the spheres, as well as the location of a light source. It then sends out rays for each pixel of the camera and calculates light bounces and intersections. The final output is a ppm file of the scene.
